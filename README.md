# 🧠 About Me

I’m a motivated computer engineering student who loves solving real-world problems through technology. I enjoy building intelligent systems, exploring data-driven solutions, and continuously learning new tools and frameworks.
Whether it’s a machine learning model, a blockchain prototype, or a web platform, I focus on creating impactful, efficient, and scalable applications.

# 🚀 Featured Projects
### 🏒 NHL Sports Betting App

#### A predictive sports analytics platform built in Python, using real-time NHL API data and multivariable regression.

🎯 Achieved a 5% accuracy margin compared to major betting apps

📊 Used NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for modeling

🔗 Integrated data pipelines and live odds monitoring

## 💰 Datathon – Polyfinance 2025

#### Developed a financial forecasting model using real market datasets during a competitive Datathon.

🧮 Applied data visualization and predictive analytics

⚙️ Implemented robust data preprocessing and evaluation pipelines

📈 Ranked among top-performing teams (Top 10)



## ⛓️ Intro to Blockchain

#### A hands-on blockchain simulation written in Python, illustrating how blocks, hashes, and transactions work.

This project demonstrates the core principles of blockchain technology — including block creation, hashing, and chain validation — using Python.

### Each block contains:

##### A list of transactions

##### A timestamp

##### The hash of the previous block

##### A nonce (for proof-of-work)

### 🔐 Hashing with SHA-256

##### To ensure data integrity and immutability, each block’s content is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm:

##### Produces a unique 256-bit (64-character) hash for every block

##### Detects any tampering instantly — if one character in the data changes, the entire hash changes

##### Links blocks securely through the previous_hash field



## 💬 SimpleChat – OCSF Implementation

#### Client-server chat application built with Java using the OCSF framework.

🖥️ Features user authentication and server-client communication

📡 Implements multiple message-handling protocols

🧱 Built for university software introduction coursework

## 💼 Experience

### 👨‍💻 Founder & Developer – AI Sentinel (03/2025 – Present)
Built a privacy-focused AI content detection platform that identifies AI-generated text, images, and videos in real time.

##### 🧠 Used TensorFlow Lite, FastAPI, and Docker

##### 🔐 Emphasized on-device inference and data privacy

### 🏁 Supervisor – Top Karting (03/2023 – Present)
##### Led a mechanical and operational team, improving efficiency by 35% while ensuring customer safety and satisfaction.
